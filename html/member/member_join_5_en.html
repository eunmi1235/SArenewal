The Buyer shall sign a Successful Bid Confirmation form confirming the purchase by him/her of the Lot on the date of the sale of such Lot (in cases in which the Buyer has made his/her bid in person and is present in the auction hall on the date of the sale) or as soon as practicable (in cases in which the Buyer did not make his/her bid in person or is not present in the auction hall on the date of the sale). Failure by the Buyer of such Lot to expressly communicate any objection immediately upon receiving the Successful Bid Confirmation form in person or by electronic means (including but not limited to social networking service platforms) will be considered an acceptance of and agreement with the terms of the Successful Bid Confirmation form.<br>

Title to the Lot, however, will not pass to the Buyer until all amounts payable by the Buyer to Seoul Auction (for itself and/or on behalf of the Consignor) under these Auction Terms, the Auction Catalogues and/or elsewhere have been received by Seoul Auction in good cleared funds<br>
